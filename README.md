# Giphy Party Lab

In this lab, we will be using the Giphy API to explore making HTTP requests and dynamically adding HTML to a page.

## Goals
By the end of this lab, you will be able to...
- use APIs to make HTTP requests and parse through responses using the Fetch API.
- identify and implement asynchronous programming with async/await functions and commands.
- create a branch using git commands and explain the purpose and importance of version control.
- understand how pull requests track changes and implement best practices for code reviews on GitHub.

## Application Features
### Core Features
- Allow the user to search for a GIF and when the form is submitted, display a limited number of results.
- Allow the user to make multiple search requests with different phrases. New results will replace old existing gifs.
- Allow the user to load more GIFs from the search
- At least one accessible feature (i.e color-sensitive choices, alt-text for images, etc)
### Stretch Features
- Explore additional properties of the Gif Object
- Incorporate various buttons that use a different API endpoint.
- Improve CSS styles with Bootstrap framework
- Incorporate :hover styling and DOM events
